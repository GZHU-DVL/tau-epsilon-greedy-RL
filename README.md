# -tau-epsilon--greedy-RL
The code for the article "(\tau,\epsilon)-GREEDY REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR ANTI-JAMMING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS"

The current code is only the code of (\tau,\epsilon)-greedy algorithm, we hope that this algorithm can be flexibly applied to different scenarios. (If the previous action cannot be selected in the current action set, such as the end of the road in the maze game, a judgment statement can be added in the code. If the previous action cannot be executed, the neural network can be directly used for calculation.)
